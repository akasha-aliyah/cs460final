## Part 1: Problem Analysis

- **Why a single shortest-path run from S is not enough:**
A single shortest-path run from S is not enough to solve this because it would only consider the immediate cheapest path,
which could ignore the fact that the next step after that could be incredibly expensive. It only compares the immediate
step, not the entire sequence of required nodes that end at T.

- **What decision remains after all inter-location costs are known:**
After considering all the inter-location costs, the decision to make it how to connect all the costs into one overall
lower costs that visits every relic chamber and ends at T.

- **Why this requires a search over orders (one sentence):**
We start by knowing the shortest travel costs, but different orders produce different total costs, which is why we need
to search over entire orders.

## Part 2: Precomputation Design

### Part 2a: Source Selection

| Source Node Type  | Why it is a source                                                                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spawn Node (S)    | We must start at the spawn node, and from there we compute each initial travel cost.       |
| Relic Nodes (R_i) | All subsequent travel costs are calculated here, from relic to relic and then to the exit. |

### Part 2b: Distance Storage

| Property | Your answer                                                             |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data structure name | dictionary of dictionaries : distance_tbl                               |
| What the keys represent | outer key : source node ; inner key : destination node                  |
| What the values represent | minimum amount of fuel needed to get from current source to destination |
| Lookup time complexity | O(1)                                                                    |
| Why O(1) lookup is possible | dictionary hashing gives us constant-time access to stored distances    |

### Part 2c: Precomputation Complexity

> State the total complexity and show the arithmetic. Two to three lines max.

- **Number of Dijkstra runs:** k + 1
- **Cost per run:** O(m log(n))
- **Total complexity:** O((k + 1)m log(n))
- **Justification (one line):** The cost of a run is given to us, and we have to run it k + 1 times, once for S and once
for each of the k relics.

## Part 3: Algorithm Correctness

> Document your understanding of why Dijkstra produces correct distances.
> Bullet points and short sentences throughout. No paragraphs.

### Part 3a: What the Invariant Means

> Two bullets: one for finalized nodes, one for non-finalized nodes.
> Do not copy the invariant text from the spec.

- **For nodes already finalized (in S):**
  _Your answer here._

- **For nodes not yet finalized (not in S):**
  _Your answer here._

### Part 3b: Why Each Phase Holds

> One to two bullets per phase. Maintenance must mention nonnegative edge weights.

- **Initialization : why the invariant holds before iteration 1:**
  _Your answer here._

- **Maintenance : why finalizing the min-dist node is always correct:**
  _Your answer here._

- **Termination : what the invariant guarantees when the algorithm ends:**
  _Your answer here._

### Part 3c: Why This Matters for the Route Planner

> One sentence connecting correct distances to correct routing decisions.

_Your answer here._

## Part 4: Search Design

### Why Greedy Fails

> State the failure mode. Then give a concrete counter-example using specific node names
> or costs (you may use the illustration example from the spec). Three to five bullets.

- **The failure mode:** _Your answer here._
- **Counter-example setup:** _Your answer here._
- **What greedy picks:** _Your answer here._
- **What optimal picks:** _Your answer here._
- **Why greedy loses:** _Your answer here._

### What the Algorithm Must Explore

> One bullet. Must use the word "order."

- _Your answer here._

## Part 5: State and Search Space

### Part 5a: State Representation

> Document the three components of your search state as a table.
> Variable names here must match exactly what you use in torchbearer.py.

| Component | Variable name in code | Data type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current location | | | |
| Relics already collected | | | |
| Fuel cost so far | | | |

### Part 5b: Data Structure for Visited Relics

> Fill in the table.

| Property | Your answer |
|---|---|
| Data structure chosen | |
| Operation: check if relic already collected | Time complexity: |
| Operation: mark a relic as collected | Time complexity: |
| Operation: unmark a relic (backtrack) | Time complexity: |
| Why this structure fits | |

### Part 5c: Worst-Case Search Space

> Two bullets.

- **Worst-case number of orders considered:** _Your answer (in terms of k)._
- **Why:** _One-line justification._

## Part 6: Pruning

### Part 6a: Best-So-Far Tracking

> Three bullets.

- **What is tracked:** _Your answer here._
- **When it is used:** _Your answer here._
- **What it allows the algorithm to skip:** _Your answer here._

### Part 6b: Lower Bound Estimation

> Three bullets.

- **What information is available at the current state:** _Your answer here._
- **What the lower bound accounts for:** _Your answer here._
- **Why it never overestimates:** _Your answer here._

### Part 6c: Pruning Correctness

> One to two bullets. Explain why pruning is safe.
